Alternatively, you can submit a private report using [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/sajjadeakbari/REPO_NAME/security/advisories) — please replace `REPO_NAME` with the actual repository name.

We typically respond within 48 hours. Once we confirm the vulnerability, we will:
- Investigate and issue a fix if needed
- Publish an advisory (if applicable)

Please give us a reasonable time to resolve the issue before any public disclosure.
