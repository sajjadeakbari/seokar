**Seokar** is a powerful and comprehensive Python library designed for in-depth on-page SEO analysis of HTML content. It helps developers and SEO professionals to audit web pages, identify issues, and get actionable recommendations to improve search engine visibility and user experience.

The library is thread-safe, memory-efficient, and provides detailed insights into meta tags, content quality, page structure, links, social media presence, and structured data.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** Covers a wide range of on-page SEO factors including:
    *   **Meta Tags:** Title (length, presence), Meta Description (length, presence), Meta Robots (directives like `noindex`, `nofollow`), Canonical URL (presence, correctness), Viewport (configuration for mobile), Charset (declaration, UTF-8 recommendation), HTML Language (declaration).
    *   **Favicon:** Detection of favicon link or default.
    *   **Heading Structure:** H1-H6 hierarchy, count (especially H1s), logical order, content length and word count for important headings.
    *   **Content Quality:** Main content length (thin content detection), Text-to-HTML ratio, Readability (Flesch Reading Ease score), Keyword Density (single words and bigrams, excluding stop words).
    *   **Image SEO:** Alt text presence, empty alt text (distinguishing decorative vs. missing), alt text length.
    *   **Link Analysis:** Internal and external links, `nofollow`, `sponsored`, `ugc` attributes, anchor text distribution (generic, branded, keyword-like).
    *   **Social Media Tags:** Open Graph (og:*) tags and Twitter Card (twitter:*) tags validation for essential properties.
    *   **Structured Data:** Detection and extraction of JSON-LD, Microdata, and RDFa, along with identified Schema.org types.
*   **Actionable Recommendations:** Provides clear, specific suggestions for fixing identified issues, categorized by severity (INFO, GOOD, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
*   **SEO Health Score:** Calculates an overall score (0-100%) based on the severity and number of issues found.
*   **Detailed Reporting:** Returns a well-structured dictionary containing all analysis results, issues, and recommendations.
*   **Thread-Safe Caching:** Implements an intelligent caching mechanism for page elements (meta tags, headings, links, etc.) to optimize performance on repeated access, with thread-safety.
*   **Robust & Reliable:** Includes strict input validation and advanced URL handling, properly resolving relative URLs and considering the page's `<base>` tag.
*   **Modern Python:** Utilizes strict type hinting (including `Literal` for Enums) for enhanced code quality and IDE support, and `dataclasses` for structured results. Optimized for memory usage with `__slots__`.
*   **Customizable Constants:** Allows for easy adjustment of SEO best practice thresholds (e.g., optimal title length, stop words) via class attributes.

print("\nIdentified Issues (Warning or higher):")
for issue in report['issues']:
    # The issue['level'] is a dictionary representation of the SEOResultLevel enum
    # Access 'value' for numeric comparison or 'name' for string representation
    if issue['level']['value'] >= SEOResultLevel.WARNING.value:
        print(f"- Type: {issue['element_type']}, Level: {issue['level']['name']}")

## üìä Understanding the Report

The `analyze()` method returns a dictionary containing a comprehensive breakdown of the SEO analysis. Key top-level keys in the report include:

*   `analyzer_version`: Version of Seokar used.
*   `url`: The URL analyzed.
*   `basic_seo`: Information on title, meta description, robots, canonical, viewport, charset, language, favicon.
*   `headings`: Data on H1-H6 tags, including their content, count, and hierarchy assessment.
*   `content_quality`: Analysis of content length, text-to-HTML ratio, readability score, and keyword density.
*   `images`: Findings related to image `alt` texts.
*   `links`: Details about internal and external links, `nofollow` attributes, and anchor text patterns.
*   `social_media_tags`: Extracted Open Graph and Twitter Card tags.
*   `structured_data`: Detected JSON-LD, Microdata, and RDFa, including Schema.org types.
*   `seo_health`: The overall SEO score and counts of critical, error, and warning issues.
*   `issues`: A list of all individual findings (dictionaries representing `SEOResult` objects, including severity level, message, details, and recommendation).
*   `recommendations`: A consolidated list of unique, actionable recommendations for high-severity issues.

Each sub-dictionary contains more granular data relevant to that specific SEO aspect.
